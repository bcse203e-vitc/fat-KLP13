Q1. A residential water board charges customers based on the volume of water consumed
during the billing period. The first 15 kiloliters (KL) are charged at ₹2 per KL, the next 20
KL are charged at ₹5 per KL, and any usage above 35 KL is charged at ₹10 per KL. Every
customer is also required to pay a fixed service charge of ₹50. Assume that no customer    
consumes a negative amount of water.





Write a script t   hat calculates and displays the water bill for each household that submitted
meter readings     yesterday. You should accept from the user the number of kiloliters used for
each household. The program should display the charge for the current household and should
also calculate and display the running total of all bills generated.
The program must use a function calculateBill() to determine the charge for each household.
Input should be obtained from the user through a text input field, and the script should
validate that the user enters a non-negative numeric value.
